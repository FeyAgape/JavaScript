### Logical operators

Logical operators can be used in conjunction with boolean values (true and false) to create complex logical expressions.
By combining two boolean values together with a logical operator, you create a logical expression that returns another boolean value. 
Hereâ€™s a description of the different logical operators:

1. &&  Logical AND value1 && value2  Returns true if both value1 and value2 evaluate to true.
2. ||  Logical OR  value1 || value2  Returns true if either value1 or value2 (or even both!) evaluates to true.
3. ! Logical NOT !value1 Returns the opposite of value1. If value1 is true, then !value1 is false.So adding it to the start of a value reverses it.
